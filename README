st - simple terminal
--------------------
This is my personal build of the simple terminal. This build is made
specifically for Debian and has the following features:

- Fonts ligatures support
- Some desktop files to make it look pretty on Gnome
- Scrolling
- It has no color themes, so you can see the colors as they should be
- It is buildable on Debian

st is a simple terminal emulator for X which sucks less.

Requirements
------------
In order to build st you need the Xlib header files.


Installation
------------
Edit config.mk to match your local setup (st is installed into
the /usr/local namespace by default).

Afterwards enter the following command to build and install st (if
necessary as root):

    make clean install


Running st
----------
If you did not install st with make clean install, you must compile
the st terminfo entry with the following command:

    tic -sx st.info

See the man page for additional details.
